### Using FluxKit

FluxKit comes with some pre-built files like:

* Basic Dispatcher
* Store
* ActionCreator

Tips :

**Using ActionCreator**
>>You can extend ActionCreator for creating a class that will create actions for a store. Use _createAction from ActionCreator for that. Every payload is composed by "actionType" and "data"

**Using Basic Dispatcher**
>> You can modify the Basic Dispatcher for custom needs

**Using Store**
>>You can extend Store for creating a store. I will comes with important methods like : addActionListener, removeActionListener and emitChange
